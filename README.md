# How to Play CHOWKABARA

## Objective:
The goal of the game is to form a straight line with three of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board. The first player to form a "mill" wins.

## Setup:
The game is played by two players.
Each player has three pieces to start.
The game board has nine intersection points where the pieces can be placed.

##Phases of the Game:

###Placement Phase:
Players take turns placing one of their pieces on any unoccupied point on the board.
Once all six pieces (three for each player) are on the board, the game moves to the movement phase.

###Movement Phase:
Players take turns moving one of their pieces to an adjacent point.
Pieces can only move to an unoccupied adjacent point.
If no adjacent points are available (all are occupied), the player loses that turn.

##Winning Condition:
The first player to form a straight line with their three pieces, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
Lines can be formed with or without the center point.
